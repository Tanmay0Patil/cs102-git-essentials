Here are some git commands learnt so far by me--
1. git init -- This command is used for initialising a local repository into a git repository.
2. git clone -- This command is used for cloning a already existing git repositories from the server into the local machine for using it.
3. git add -- This command is used for adding files or directories into staging area for the next commit.
4. git commit -- This command is used to commit all the changes and store them as the snapshot.
5. git push -- This command is used for pushing of all the information(data changed like files or directories) from the local machine to the server repositories.

Short summary:
Git is a popular version control system used by software developers to track changes in their codebase. Here are some commonly used Git commands:

git init: Initializes a new Git repository in your current directory.
git add: Adds files to the staging area for committing.
git commit: Records changes to the repository with a commit message.
git status: Shows the current status of the repository.
git log: Displays a history of all commits in the repository.
git branch: Lists all branches in the repository.
git checkout: Switches to a different branch or commit.
git merge: Merges changes from one branch to another.
git pull: Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository.
git push: Pushes changes to a remote repository.
These commands are just the basics, but they provide a solid foundation for working with Git. There are many other Git commands and features that you can explore as you become more comfortable with the tool.
