Here are some git commands learnt so far by me--
1. git init -- This command is used for initialising a local repository into a git repository.
2. git clone -- This command is used for cloning a already existing git repositories from the server into the local machine for using it.
3. git add -- This command is used for adding files or directories into staging area for the next commit.
4. git commit -- This command is used to commit all the changes and store them as the snapshot.
5. git push -- This command is used for pushing of all the information(data changed like files or directories) from the local machine to the server repositories.
